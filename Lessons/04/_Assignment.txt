* Read "Objective 1.5: Implement exception handling" to be able to:
	- compare using exceptions and error codes.
	- explain an unhandled exception.
	- handle an exception by using try ... catch in an efficient way.
	- understand all properties of System.Exception type - StackTrace, InnerException, Message, HelpLink, HResult, Source, TargetSite, Data.
	- understand main exception types from .Net framework.
	- use "finally" block in an efficient way.
	- use Environment.FailFast() method.
	- throw an exception.
	- explain a difference between try { } catch(<ExceptionType>) { throw; } and try { } catch(<ExceptionType> exception) { throw exception; }
	- create a custom exception and throw it. Why use [Serializable]?
	- use ExceptionDispatchInfo type to move exception handling to another thread.
	- understand why direct usage of Exception is not a good practice.

* Walk through examples _01_ManyCatchBranches to _04_ExceptionDispatchInfo.

* Solve TaskA - TaskE.
	 
* Commit all changes into your branch in the respository.
