	- explain delegates.
	- demonstrate adding and removing method from a delegate.
	- understand chaining of delegates with return value.
	- explain contravariance and covariance for delegates.
	- use lambda expressions with explicitly as well as implicity typed parameters.
	- use MulticastDelegate.GetInvocationList(), support for asynchronous invocation.
	- use predefined delegates from System namespace - Action, Func, Predicate.
	- explain publisher-subscriber design pattern.
	- provide an event and raise it.
	- explain cons of using an Action as a property instead of "event".
	- use EventHandler<T> and EventArgs types.
	- use custom event accessors add { }, remove { }
* Walk through examples _01_Delegate.cs - _08_Events.cs.
