**Objective 4.5: Store data in and retrieve data from collections

- explain what an array is, how is declared, what cases is optimal for.
- explain difference between multidimensional and jagged arrays.
- know consequences of using generic and non-generic versions of collection types.
- choose the most suitable collection according to a scenario.
- enumerate all members of ICollection<T> interface.
- use List, List<T> in proper way - typical scenarios, members.
- use Dictionary, Dictionary<K,V> in proper way - typical scenarios, members.
- explain using of methods of ISet<T>.
- use HashSet<T> type.
- understand Push, Pop, Peek methods on Stack<T>.
- understand Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek methods on Queue<T>.
- implement your own collection.

Tasks:

A. Implement UniqueList<T> as a custom collection that behaves exactly as List<T> but does not allow inserting duplicate items.
   The collection must throw exceptions as per its doucmentation comment.
   Make sure you test your solution for all methods that can insert items (Add, AddRange, Insert, InsertRange).
   Hint: You can inherit from List<T> to save a lot of work.

B. Class MyList<T> needs a few changes in order to run code in "Run()" method. 
   Make the necessary modifications, then uncomment the code and run it.

C. Implement TaskC.IsCzBankHoliday(). 
   Use a jagged array to hold bank holidays in 2017 in the Czech Republic. Structure the array by months.
