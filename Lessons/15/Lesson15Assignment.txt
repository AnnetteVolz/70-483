Objective 4.3: Query and manipulate data and objects by using LINQ

- explain anonymous types.
- explain differences between query syntax and method syntax of LINQ statements.
- use the most frequently used LINQ methods / statements. 

Tasks:

A. Write an method extending LINQ to rotate elements in a collection by given positions:
(new[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}).Rotate(2); // expected: {4, 5, 1, 2, 3}

B. Write an method extending LINQ to slice elements in a collection:
(new[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}).Slice(2); // expected: {{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5}}

C. Check TaskC.cs file. Use data with our locations and : 
- Write a method to get distance between two points defined by latitude and longitude.
- Use one linq statement to print out Top 10 of the furthest locations pairs, e.g. [LocationA, LocationB] = 1234 km
- Use one linq statement to print out Top 10 of the nearest locations pairs.

D. There is YatzyCalculator class in TaskD.cs Implement all methods of the class by using LINQ statements.
Use pre-prepared XUnit unit tests to speed up your implementation.
